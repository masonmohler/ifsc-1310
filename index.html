  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is a way of creating websites which focuses on the content of the website above all else.  The main idea behind progressive enhancement is that you should, ideally, build a website from the inside-out and not from the outside-in.
    You first add the content in the form of HTML, making sure that it is a completely solid, standalone experience.  Then you <em>progressively</em> add <strong>enhancements</strong>, such as <strong>CSS</strong> to style the content or <strong>Javascript</strong> to control how the content reacts.
    Based on the principles of progressive enhancement, though, your site should function without any Javascript, in the case that the user's browser does not support it, and the content should still be conveyed neatly, even without CSS.
  </p>
  <p>
    The concept of progressive enhancement is important in modern web developoment because it allows your website to be as complete as possible, no matter how the user is viewing it.  Essentially, it lets users whose broswers may be older still
    have a good baseline experience on your site without any enhancements.  The progressive enhancement strategy is very useful because it gives your website a strong base structure, but still allows you to build out higher level features for users with
    more updated software.  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">This article</a> talks more about progressive enhancement in more technical terms.

  <h2>Segway Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    For this project, I chose to make a website for the new concept vehicle from Segway: the Centaur.  I had a lot of fun making this project, but it was definitely challenging in some areas.
    When I started working on this assignment I realized that my CSS skills were not as strong as I thought were, but that rapidly changed throughout the completion of
    my first draft.  The biggest surprise for me was that deciding on a color scheme was one of the hardest parts of this assignment.  I originally went with several green tones, but after seeing the colors in the logo I realized that it would
    probably be easier to just build the color scheme around the logo I was already provided.  For the header, I wanted to do an SVG background because I think they are cool, so I found one that matched the vibe of the logo and I removed the background from the
    logo so that it would all flow together.  The next thing I made was the consistent navigation element, which was initially very challenging, but as I figured out various different hover effects for the buttons and hammered out a color scheme it really started to come together.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the home page, I built a pretty basic layout.  I used a heading at the beginning of each section, followed by a picture and a sort paragraph of content.  I also went to Segway's website and found some specifications for the Centaur, which I marked up
    into a table and styled for maximized readability.  For the about page, I simply had a main heading and several paragraphs of text about the company, styled consistently with the rest of the pages.  For the FAQs page, I utilized the details tag to
    create a dropdown menu.  I also added a cool hover effect using an inset box shadow, similar to the effect I used on the navigation buttons, but going from left to right instead of top to bottom.  Lastly, for the contact page, I used Wufoo to create
    a customized contact form that functions completely and matches the theme of my website.
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt like I had a really strong first iteration.  I put a lot of time and effort into the final product, and I was satisfied with it.  There were a few things, though, that my friends had issues with on the site which needed to be addressed.  
    When navigating the site, the first thing they noticed was that my content was difficult to read and the home page looked messy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon hearing this, I realized my font was too small, and once I increased the size of the font on several elements it became much easier to read.  On the home page, I changed the display properties of the paragraphs to fix the 
    text wrapping in a strange way around the images.  This made the content much more readable and less cluttered.  On the FAQs page I didn't change much because I recieved a lot of positive feedback on that section, but I did increase
    the size of the font to make the FAQ tiles more readable.  On the about page, I recieved feedback that it was too baren, so I implemented the Javascript image carousel that we learned about in class underneath the main content, and that
    seemed to make the page look more full.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout this entire semester, I learned so much about web design and development, and I'm really happy with the progress I have made.  CSS used to confuse me so much, but now I'm much more confident in my skills.  The only thing I would change
    is that I wish I could've spent more time on Javascript, it seems very powerful and I'd love to explore more of its applications.  I initially took this class because I needed it to graduate, but I really enjoyed the teaching style and all the
    hands-on projects.  When I started this semester I knew basically nothing about front-end development, and now I feel like I could make any website I wanted to with enough effort, determination, and help from strangers on the internet.
